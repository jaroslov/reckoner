I'm using a *really* ghetto method for doing CAD:

1. Open design.html in firefox;
2. Open the specific svg you want to develop in a text editor; and,
3. Enjoy!

Its a bit more unix-ey than using a real CAD, and certainly a lot easier. More like developing a web-app than doing design work. Because, GODDAMN, figuring out CAD/vector-art tools is impossible.
